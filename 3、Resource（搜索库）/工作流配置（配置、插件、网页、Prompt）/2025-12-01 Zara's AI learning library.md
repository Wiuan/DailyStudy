Video Podcasts

For those with **👁 Watch** tags, I recommend watching the video versions (instead of just listening to the audio), because many of these feature visual information like product demos/screen shares  
  
For proper learning, consume them from start to finish. Don't just generate a summary with AI 👀  
  
I include the YouTube links because I prefer the video versions. For audio versions, type the show names into any podcast apps to listen

AI dictionary 人工智能词典

[View demo 查看演示](https://x.com/zarazhangrui/status/1991047223715770803?s=20)

Build an AI dictionary with these features.

  
User first select their native language and target language (for each, options include the 10 most popular languages in the world).  

User can input with text (word, phrase, sentence).  
  

The result displays a natural language definition in the user's native language, as well as an AI-generated image visualizing the concept. It also includes 2 example sentences, each followed by a translation in the user's native language. It also includes an usage note, which explains the cultural nuance, how it's used, tone/voice, or related words (synonyms/words that look similar and are often confused) and how they differ in usage. The explanation should be fun, lively, and in casual language, like you're talking to a friend. Don't sound like a textbook. Be concise. No greetings or fillers; get to the point immediately.  

  
For each word or phrase defined, provide a button that plays a clear audio recording of its pronunciation in the target language. Make sure it sounds natural, not robotic. All example sentences should also have a pronunciation feature. Make sure the audio latency is low.  
  

The user can choose to save any result page to their "Notebook" for review later.

  
In the Notebook, there's a feature where the AI can "make up a story" using the words/phrases contained in the notebook, in order to help the user memorize them.  
  

There's a "Study" mode, where the AI generates flashcards for words in the notebook, where the front is the word in the target language against the image that represents the word, and the back is the word and its definition in native language (along with example sentence). When they click on the card, there should be a flipping animation.  
  

Make it mobile-optimized. Overall vibe is bright and fun. Make it pop.

Video recorder with live prompting  
带实时提示的录像机

[View demo 查看演示](https://x.com/zarazhangrui/status/1991009823614513479?s=20)

A web app that hooks up to the user's camera that lets users record videos of themselves talking to the camera.  
  
The AI should display good prompts (questions) to get the user's creative juices flowing so they know what to talk about.  
  
After recording, the user should be able to download the video as a mp4 file.  
  
Also allow the user to choose dimension of video (9:16, 16:9, 3:4, 1:1).  
  
Have Gemini actively listen in on what the user is saying and jump in with live questions at various points (as overlay text only, no audio) so the user is never stuck, so it's like the AI is a video podcast host interviewing the user.  
  
Use pastel colors and make the design classy. Make sure the UI auto-adjusts for all video layouts.
