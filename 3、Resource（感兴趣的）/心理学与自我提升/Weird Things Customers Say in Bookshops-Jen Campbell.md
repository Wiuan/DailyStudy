## Tales From the Edinburgh Bookshop

> 📌 CUSTOMER: Do you have any positions available at the moment? I’d like my daughter to get a Saturday job.BOOKSELLER: If your daughter is interested in working for us, it’d be best if she came and spoke to us herself.CUSTOMER: I don’t think she’s that keen on having a job, that’s the problem... But you could always come round to our house and try and convince her to come and work for you. Then she might consider it.
